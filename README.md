
# Project About:
 Allow users to look up viruses and learn more information about it. The application will  pull up information such as available vaccines, range of cells, tissues, and hosts the virus infects, past viral outbreaks involving the virus that the user can read. 



# Application Platform:
The platform of our project will be PHP.  Oracle will be used as our DBMS and HTML will be used for building the UI with PHP.

# Notes:
In the sql script, there are assertions needed to be implemented. However, create assertion is not supported by Oracle, hence we will note where assertions are needed instead of implementing them.
